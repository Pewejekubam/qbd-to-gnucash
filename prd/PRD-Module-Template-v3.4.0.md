## 1. Overview
Brief description of the module, its purpose, and its role in the system.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- [ ] List all functional requirements for this module.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] List all non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.).

## 4. Interface Contract
### 4.1 Public Functions/Classes
- [ ] For each function/class, specify:
  - Name
  - Arguments (names and types, using Python typing)
  - Return type (using Python typing)
  - Exceptions raised
  - Docstring/description (1-2 lines)
  - Example call (see below)

#### Example:
```
def parse_iif_accounts(iif_path: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
    """Parse an IIF file and return a list of account records."""
    Raises: IIFParseError
    Example: records = parse_iif_accounts('input/sample.iif')
```

### 4.2 Data Structures
- [ ] Document any custom data structures or expected input/output formats.
- [ ] Specify types using Python typing (e.g., List[Dict[str, Any]], Optional[str]).
- [ ] For custom structures, list all fields with their types and a brief description.

## 5. Error Handling and Logging
- [ ] This module must comply with all requirements in [Logging Framework module PRD v1.0.0](logging/module-prd-logging-v1.0.0.md) and [core PRD section 7.12](core-prd-v3.2.0.md#712-logging-and-error-handling).
- [ ] Remove module-specific logging/error handling requirements; see the centralized logging module for details.

## 6. Change Management
- [ ] Any change to a shared interface must be reflected in this PRD and communicated to all dependent modules.
- [ ] Review process for interface changes is required.
- [ ] Update all relevant documentation and test cases upon interface change.

## 7. Test Cases and Examples
- [ ] For every public function/class, provide a realistic example call that matches the documented signature and reflects a real use case.

## 8. Checklist
- [ ] All function signatures are explicitly documented.
- [ ] All interface contracts are complete and clear.
- [ ] Error handling and logging requirements are met via the centralized logging module.
- [ ] Error Logging and Graceful Exit: All errors and exceptions are logged and flushed before process exit, as per core PRD section 7.12 and the logging module.
- [ ] Change management process is defined.
- [ ] Test cases/examples are provided.
- [ ] A README.md document is created for this module, summarizing its purpose, usage, and version history.
