# üìê PRD Governance Model ‚Äî Protocol-Driven Requirements Management

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the structural, procedural, and formatting rules that govern how all Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) are authored, maintained, and evolved. It ensures that all PRDs remain deterministic, agent-compatible, version-controlled, and scalable across AI-assisted development workflows.

This governance model is binding for all human contributors, AI agents, and automated systems. It supersedes any prior formatting or update practices.

---

## 2. Objectives

All governed PRD documents must:

- Maintain strict formatting and structural discipline
- Be immediately parsable and executable by autonomous agents without transformation
- Support modular growth without ambiguity, duplication, or drift
- Enable precise, scoped, and traceable change control
- Enforce rollback-safe editing and loggable lifecycle changes
- Provide consistency across contributors, systems, and generations

---

## 3. Structure Enforcement

### 3.1 Section Numbering

- All documents begin with a level-two header: `## 1. [Title]`
- Sections increment continuously (`## 2.`, `## 3.`...) with no gaps or duplication
- Subsections follow nested numbering (`### 4.1`, `#### 4.1.1`)
- Numbering must be corrected across all PRDs in a single coherent renumbering pass

### 3.2 Section Headers

- Section headers are semantically stable and must not be reworded or stylistically altered
- Do not rename, shorten, or paraphrase any existing header without explicit directive
- All anchor links and internal references must be updated during section movement or renumbering

---

## 4. Update Discipline

### 4.1 Scope Control

- Edits must be surgically scoped ‚Äî apply only to the directive at hand
- Do not alter unrelated logic, formatting, or adjacent content
- New logic must be inserted at the semantically correct location

### 4.2 Formatting Constraints

- Do not summarize, infer, simplify, or optimize structure without explicit instruction
- Do not add examples, commentary, or opinionated phrasing unless directed
- Preserve code block formatting, list styles, and indentation exactly

### 4.3 Changelog Requirements

- All PRD updates must be logged in a version history or changelog
- Inline edit marks or annotations are prohibited unless requested by protocol

---

## 5. Modular PRD Integrity

### 5.1 Modular Structure

- Each functional domain (e.g., `accounts`, `vendors`, `mapping`) must have a standalone PRD
- The core PRD defines shared infrastructure, architecture, and process orchestration
- Modules must declare their version and compatible core version

### 5.2 Inter-PRD Coordination

- Cross-module references must use relative paths and maintainable anchors
- Logic unique to a module must live in its own PRD, not in core
- Shared behaviors must be abstracted upward only when generically applicable

---

## 6. Agentic Compatibility Rules

All PRDs must be designed for first-pass execution by autonomous agents:

- Canonical formatting for function definitions, schemas, and examples
- Interface contracts defined with `TypedDict`, JSON Schema, or equivalent
- Explicit exception types and exit codes
- Validation suite contracts and edge-case handling
- Deterministic, flush-safe logging rules

---

## 7. Protocol Hierarchy

When conflicts arise, this document overrides:

- All legacy prompts, inline notes, or formatting opinions
- Any AI model heuristics or auto-correction behaviors
- Any human contributor‚Äôs intent to "optimize" without mandate

All ambiguities must be escalated through a clarification request, not silently resolved.

---

## 8. Enforcement Notes

- AI agents must explicitly acknowledge this policy before performing structural edits
- Human contributors must verify compliance before submitting or merging updates
- Any violation may invalidate the resulting PRD version, changelog, or downstream generation

---

## 9. Tools and Automation

The following systems are expected in mature implementations of this model and will be included in production as the roadmap develops:

- **PRD Template Generator** ‚Äî scaffolds module PRDs conforming to this governance
- **PRD Validator** ‚Äî checks for structural compliance, numbering, and canonical syntax
- **PRD Review Workflow** ‚Äî enforces agentic + human review before integration
- **PRD Documentation Browser** ‚Äî enables indexed browsing of modular PRDs
