Refactor the entire PRD document-base under `./prd/` so that all section and subsection numbers (##, ###, ####, etc.) are strictly continuous and sequential, with no gaps, duplications, or out-of-order numbering. Update all cross-references and inbound links accordingly. Ensure the document is fully agentic AI-compatible, with canonical formatting and no stylistic drift. Perform a comprehensive, single-pass audit and correction, and provide a summary table of all section headers and their new numbers for verification.
