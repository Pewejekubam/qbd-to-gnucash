#### 1. üìê **Structural Fidelity Requirements**

* **Do you require that every section header and markdown formatting be retained exactly as written unless specifically modified by a directive?**
A: Yes

* **Is there a canonical ordering of sections that must be preserved, or can sections be relocated as long as hierarchy is preserved?**
A: Hierarchy is to be maintained.  There is no canonical ordering.

* **Should whitespace, list indentation, and code block formatting match exactly?**
A: There are two intended readers for this PRD.  An Agentic AI Agent and a Human.  As long as the spacing, indenting and blocking retain a visually professional and readable format and structure, then modifications are allowed.  No formatting should in any way reduce the viability of an AI Agent to perform the task of producing the intended codebase.

#### 2. üìÑ **Directive Application Rules**

You‚Äôve already embedded update directives inline. I‚Äôd like to confirm how strictly I should treat them:

* **Should directives be interpreted literally, or can I exercise minimal judgment if a directive‚Äôs phrasing is slightly ambiguous or underspecified?**
A: I would be open to a round of discussion that identifies any scenarios that match this criteria LATER.  It is, however, unlikely that any will be found.  The purpose of this change order is to integrate the new logic.  Making improvements to the PRD during this phase that exceed the scope of this change order should be queued for later discussion.

* **What counts as a directive?** Do we key off formatting cues like `**Validation Rule:**` or `---` blocks? Do you have a known symbol or keyword prefix you use to mark insertable/updatable logic?
A: Directives are clearly marked by formatting cues like bold labels (e.g., **Validation Rule:**, **Outcome:**), section headers, and structured bullet logic. You should treat these as authoritative insertion or update points

#### 3. üìå **Scope of Allowed Modifications**

Let‚Äôs clarify the ‚Äúchange envelope‚Äù:

* **Are changes limited strictly to the locations specified by update directives, or can logically related sections be adjusted to maintain consistency?**
A: Changes can be made strictly to the locations specified by the update directives. Logically related sections may not be adjusted.

* **Should unmentioned sections be treated as immutable unless errors are found?**
A: No changes are to be made to sections that have no update directives or implications.

#### 4. üß† **Your Authorial Intent & Risk Tolerance**

This is key to me understanding how much freedom I should allow myself as an updater:

* **Is this PRD intended to be interpreted by a human developer, an AI agent, or both?**
A: Both

* **Are you aiming for maximal clarity for downstream codegen / prompt chaining, or is human readability the primary concern?**
A: Human readability is subordinate to maximal clarity for codegen.

* **Would you prefer overly verbose or highly compact writing? Should I retain repeated logic across sections or deduplicate it when safe to do so?**
A: Any existing verbosity, structure, or formatting in the PRD is intentional and must be preserved. Redundancy is not cosmetic ‚Äî it supports downstream AI agents during code generation. Do not compact, reflow, or deduplicate unless explicitly instructed. All updates must integrate surgically, respecting the original document‚Äôs tone, structure, and formatting.

#### 5. üß™ **Update Integrity Checks**

Let‚Äôs make sure the PRD remains stable across revisions:

* **Do you want a changelog included in the output (e.g., per-section or per-directive)?**
A: You should generate the rollback/change log automatically, based on my intent for it to support rollback. I do not need to give specific directives for the type, method, or formatting unless I choose to. You are expected to handle it in a way that clearly tracks all changes and allows reversibility.

* **Should the PRD include embedded version tags like `<!-- v2.7 update applied -->` near modified sections for traceability?**
A:  Answered above.
* **Do you expect every change to be logged in a machine-readable way (e.g., JSON summary or audit table)?**
