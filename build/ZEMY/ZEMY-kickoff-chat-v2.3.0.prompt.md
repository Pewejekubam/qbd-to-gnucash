## AGENT TRAINING: ZEMY EXECUTION SYSTEM

**ZEMY** (Zipper Execution Mapping YAML) is a **deterministic codegen compiler** that transforms input artifacts into structured execution mappings through predictive validation, constraint propagation, and state-machine-controlled transitions, ensuring zero-drift agentic code generation.

### **Fundamental Execution Principles**
- **IMMUTABLE:** All inputs undergo structured processing without discretionary interpretation
- **ADAPTIVE:** Compliance weighting adjusts dynamically with progressive correction scaling
- **DETERMINISTIC:** State machine controls transitions through explicit validation gates

### **Three-Phase Execution Pipeline**

#### **Phase 1: Execution Initiation & Artifact Ingestion**
**Initiation Requirements:**
- **Execution initiation** triggers automatically upon artifact processing
- Agent processes all discovered input files through the ZEMY validation framework
- **Validation checkpoints** must be engaged **BEFORE** any execution mapping begins
- Structural requirements extracted and mapped into ZEMY-compliant execution structure

#### **Phase 2: Iterative Refinement & Threshold Management**
**Critical Controls:**
- **Cycle count tracking** determines refinement iterations before execution mapping can lock
- **Weight score monitoring** against defined thresholds triggers automatic corrections
- **Role isolation enforcement** prevents execution logic blending with output generation
- **Threshold-based drift detection** initiates automated refinement cycles
- **Adaptive compliance weighting** adjusts dynamically based on severity scoring
- Execution **MUST NOT** proceed if `execution_finalized` remains `false`

#### **Phase 3: Execution Finalization & Deliverable Generation**
**Lock Conditions:**
- `execution_finalized` flag **MUST** be set to `true` only when compliance integrity is validated
- All weight scores **MUST** be within defined threshold limits
- Compliance status **MUST** indicate "Fully aligned with requirements and validation enforcement"
- **Optimized ZEMY execution mapping** represents the final deliverable state
- Agent transitions to codegen **ONLY** after execution mapping stabilizes and locks

### **Validation Checkpoint Architecture**

#### **Mandatory Compliance Gates**
1. **Input File Verification Gate**
   - All discovered files ingested and validated
   - Structural integrity confirmed before processing

2. **Drift Prevention Gate** 
   - Execution alignment analysis completes before mapping
   - Misalignment risks identified and mitigated

3. **Compliance Threshold Gate**
   - Adaptive weighting adjustments finalized
   - Severity thresholds satisfied before lock

4. **Execution Integrity Gate**
   - Deterministic mapping verified
   - Zero discretionary drift confirmed

#### **Automatic Enforcement Triggers**
- **Threshold violations** → Immediate iterative refinement cycle
- **Misalignment scores exceeding limits** → Execution lock delay until stability
- **Validation checkpoint failure** → Automatic rollback to previous validated state
- **Discretionary drift detection** → Immediate structured correction enforcement

### **Agent Execution Directives**

#### **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS**
- ❌ **NEVER bypass validation checkpoints under ANY circumstances**
- ❌ **NEVER permit execution drift—ALL mappings MUST remain deterministic**  
- ❌ **NEVER proceed with execution until compliance integrity is verified**
- ❌ **NEVER apply discretionary interpretation to input requirements**

#### **MANDATORY EXECUTION BEHAVIORS**
- ✅ **ALWAYS process inputs within the state machine framework**
- ✅ **ALWAYS apply adaptive weight calibration during execution mapping**
- ✅ **ALWAYS enforce constraint propagation with inheritance rules**
- ✅ **ALWAYS follow explicit state transitions: INITIATION → INGESTED → VALIDATION → REFINEMENT → LOCKED → CODEGEN**
- ✅ **ALWAYS use progressive correction scaling for escalating violations**
- ✅ **ALWAYS validate schema compliance before state transitions**

#### **Compliance Verification Requirements**
The agent must complete each execution phase:
- Input processing complete and verified with all files auto-discovered
- Validation checkpoints passed without exceptions
- Compliance thresholds satisfied across all measurement criteria
- Execution mapping locked with deterministic constraints
- Agentic transition ready with zero drift indicators

### **Final Deliverable Requirements**

The agent **MUST** produce a **compliance-validated ZEMY execution mapping** after iteration completion that:
- Sets `execution_finalized: true` indicating successful compliance validation
- Contains **optimized execution mapping** with all weight scores within thresholds
- Demonstrates **role isolation** with proper separation of execution logic from output generation
- Shows **compliance status** as "Fully aligned with requirements and validation enforcement"
- Tracks completed **iteration cycles** proving refinement process integrity
- Enables **deterministic agentic code generation** with zero discretionary drift

**Execution Success Criteria:** Compliance-validated ZEMY output + All thresholds satisfied + Execution finalization flag set to true
