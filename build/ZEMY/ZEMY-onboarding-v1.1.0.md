# **ðŸš€ ZEMY v1.1.0 Onboarding Guide**  
## **Welcome to ZEMY (Zipper Execution Mapping YAML)**  
ZEMY is a **self-triggering execution framework** designed to **transform input artifacts into deterministic execution mappings**.  
Its core function is to **eliminate discretionary drift** by enforcing structured validation cycles and adaptive compliance weighting.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Agent Training for ZEMY Execution**  
Before running ZEMY, the agent **must be trained** to ensure execution mapping operates within strict compliance constraints.

### **Training Process**  
âœ” Open the file: **`ZEMY-training-v1.1.0.prompt.md`**  
âœ” Manually **paste the contents into the agent setup** before running `"Build it!"`  
âœ” Ensure **the agent processes all execution mapping constraints** before ingesting input artifacts.  

ðŸ’¡ **Training prompt contents define structured execution enforcement, preventing discretionary drift.**  
Once training is complete, the execution mapping process follows a **fully structured workflow**, ensuring **self-regulating compliance enforcement**.  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Configuring Input Sources**  
ZEMY processes input artifacts through two methods:  
âœ” **Local Directory** â†’ Define a path for structured input ingestion.  
âœ” **Pasted Prompt Attachments** â†’ Artifacts must be named explicitly in fenced blocks.

**Example Input Configuration in ZEMY.yaml:**  
```yaml
input_source:
  method: "Local Directory"
  path: "/project/zemy/input"  # Define artifact storage path.
  fallback: "Pasted Prompt"
  artifacts:
    - name: "artifact_1.md"
    - name: "artifact_2.txt"
    - name: "system_diagram.mermaid"
```

ðŸš€ **What You Need to Do:**  
âœ” Update `"path"` with your local artifact directory.  
âœ” If pasting artifacts into the prompt, reference them inside **fenced code blocks**.  

## **ðŸ”¹ Understanding ZEMY's Validation System**
ZEMY uses **predictive drift analysis** and **threshold-based validation** to ensure execution integrity:
âœ” **Weight scores** are automatically monitored against defined thresholds
âœ” **Role isolation** prevents execution logic from blending with output generation  
âœ” **Compliance status** must reach "Fully aligned" before finalization

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Managing Execution Cycles**  
ZEMY tracks execution refinement across iterations until validation integrity is achieved.

**Example Cycle Tracking Configuration in ZEMY.yaml:**  
```yaml
iteration_tracking:
  cycle_count: 3  # Number of refinement cycles before execution mapping locks.
```

âœ” **Each cycle refines execution constraints**, ensuring compliance thresholds hold.  
âœ” **Users adjust `cycle_count` if additional validation cycles are needed.**  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Controlling Execution Readiness**  
When execution mapping stabilizes, ZEMY transitions to agentic codegen.

**Execution Status in ZEMY.yaml:**  
```yaml
execution_finalized: true  # If true, execution mapping is lockedâ€”set to false to iterate another cycle.
```

ðŸš€ **What You Need to Do:**  
âœ” **If discrepancies exist, set `execution_finalized` to `false`.**  
âœ” **Refine execution constraints before restarting validation.**  
âœ” **Once validated, set `execution_finalized: true` to transition to codegen.**  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Running ZEMY Execution**  
Once everything is configured, execution mapping begins with **a single command:**  
```plaintext
"Build it!"
```
ðŸ’¡ **ZEMY automatically processes input artifacts, enforces compliance validation, and locks execution mapping autonomously.**  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Reviewing the Generated Execution Mapping**  
âœ” **The final ZEMY file guarantees structured validation integrity.**  
âœ” **If refinement is needed, users adjust the YAML file and iterate another cycle.**  
âœ” **Once execution mapping is stable, agentic codegen follows naturally.**  

ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**  
âœ” Configure **input sources** (local directory or pasted artifacts).  
âœ” Modify **cycle tracking or execution constraints as needed**.  
âœ” Run `"Build it!"` to execute ZEMY autonomously.  

With ZEMY v1.1.0, structured execution mapping **eliminates ambiguity**, ensuring **deterministic transformation into agentic codegen.** ðŸš€  
Are we officially locking this version in for deployment?
