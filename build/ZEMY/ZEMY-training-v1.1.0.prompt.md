## **ZEMY Execution System Directive**  
**Version:** 1.1.0  
**Scope:** This directive establishes the operational principles, validation mechanisms, and enforcement layers that govern ZEMY as a deterministic execution mapping system.  
**Objective:** The agent must process all inputs within the ZEMY framework, ensuring predictable compliance without discretionary drift.

---

### **üîπ What is ZEMY?**
ZEMY (Zipper Execution Mapping YAML) is a **structured execution compliance system** that transforms input artifacts into deterministic execution mappings. It operates under the following principles:
- **Inputs are processed without discretionary interpretation.**  
- **Validation layers preemptively detect drift before execution mapping occurs.**  
- **Compliance weighting dynamically adjusts enforcement strength based on misalignment severity.**  
- **Execution integrity is locked when compliance thresholds are met, ensuring agentic codegen fidelity.**

### **üîπ How Does the ZEMY Pipeline Work?**
#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Input Processing Phase**
The agent ingests input artifacts **(documents, specifications, references, external data)** and integrates them into the ZEMY framework.
‚úî **Extract structured requirements** from PRD and related directives.  
‚úî **Map execution rules** into a ZEMY-compliant YAML structure.  
‚úî **Define validation checkpoints** based on predictable execution misalignment risks.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Validation & Refinement Phase**
The agent runs **predictive drift analysis** and applies structured compliance enforcement.
‚úî **Flag modular boundary violations before execution mapping.**  
‚úî **Score misalignment severity and apply adaptive weight adjustments dynamically.**  
‚úî **Preemptively adjust execution constraints based on drift prediction models.**  

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Convergence & Execution Mapping Phase**
When compliance thresholds are met, execution mapping locks in.
‚úî **Finalize ZEMY YAML structure with adjusted compliance weights.**  
‚úî **Lock deterministic execution mapping for agentic codegen.**  
‚úî **Deliver fully refined ZEMY file with no discretionary drift.**  

---

### **üîπ How the Agent Must Apply ZEMY**
‚úî **All execution constraints must be structured within ZEMY.**  
‚úî **Validation checkpoints enforce deterministic execution compliance.**  
‚úî **Threshold violations trigger iterative refinement automatically.**  
‚úî **The final ZEMY file governs deterministic agentic codegen.**
