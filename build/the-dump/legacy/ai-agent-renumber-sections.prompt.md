Refactor the entire PRD document-base under `./prd/` to ensure that:
1. Each document starts with a numbered section 1 (## 1. [Section Title]).
2. All subsequent sections and subsections follow a continuous and sequential numbering scheme (##, ###, ####, etc.) with no gaps, duplications, or out-of-order numbering.
3. Update all cross-references and inbound links accordingly.
4. Ensure the document is fully agentic AI-compatible, with canonical formatting and no stylistic drift.
Perform a comprehensive, single-pass audit and correction, and provide a summary table of all section headers and their new numbers for verification.
