# CR-2025-002 COMPLETION DOCUMENT
*PRD Governance Specification Precision Enhancement*

**Document ID:** CR-2025-002-COMPLETION  
**Date:** 2025-06-10  
**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Core PRD Version:** v3.9.1  
**Governance Model Version:** v2.7.0  

---

## IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

CR-2025-002 successfully addressed **PRD governance specification gaps** that created conflicting requirements during LFC artifact generation. All enhancements were implemented within the existing governance framework to eliminate specification conflicts and enable reliable horizontal scaling patterns.

**Mission Accomplished:** Enhanced governance specification precision within existing architectural framework to prevent future module development conflicts.

## COMPLETED REQUIREMENTS

### ✅ 1. Interface Authority Specification Clarity
**Implementation:** Core PRD Section 11.5 "Interface Authority Precedence Rules"
- Established Core PRD Section 11.3.1 as authoritative for cross-module interface patterns
- Defined Module PRD Section 6.2 as compliant implementation layer
- Documented conflict resolution hierarchy: Core PRD > Module PRD
- Added consistency requirements and implementation standards

### ✅ 2. Module Responsibility Matrix Specification Enhancement  
**Implementation:** Core PRD Section 12.1 "Enhanced Module Boundary Specification Matrix"
- Added explicit "belongs/doesn't belong" decision matrix table
- Strengthened enforcement language for governance violations
- Provided comprehensive correct/incorrect examples using existing modules
- Enhanced developer checklist with precise boundary rules

### ✅ 3. Specification Conflict Prevention Framework
**Implementation:** Authority precedence rules and deterministic protocols
- Interface authority precedence eliminates specification ambiguity
- Error implementation protocol provides deterministic guidance
- PRD reference formatting ensures governance compliance
- Removed contradictory CLI references throughout document

### ✅ 4. Module Entry Point Standardization
**Implementation:** Core PRD Section 11.6 "Module Entry Point Standards"
- Standardized naming convention: `run_<domain>_pipeline(payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool`
- Defined payload parameter requirements (core_dispatch_payload_v1 schema)
- Established implementation pattern for consistent dispatch integration
- Focused on deterministic specifications for LFC recognition

---
