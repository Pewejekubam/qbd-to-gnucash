# Change Request CR-003: Module Console Logging Standards & Text Workflow Enhancement

**Document Version:** CR-003-v4.0.0  
**Change Request ID:** CR-003  
**Target Document:** module-prd-accounts_mapping-v1.1.0.md  
**Author:** Pewe Jekubam
**Date:** 2025-06-12  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation  

---

## 1. Overview
Establish standardized console logging conventions and complete text workflow implementation with comprehensive edge case handling for module PRDs to ensure consistent user experience across horizontal module scaling while preserving domain autonomy and separation of concerns.

---

## 2. Rationale
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Prepare for future modules (sales_tax, customers, vendors, etc.) with consistent console output patterns
- **User Experience:** Provide scannable, hierarchical console logs that clearly show processing flow
- **Domain Autonomy:** Maintain module control over their specific console messaging without core infrastructure changes
- **Pattern Consistency:** Create "soft standards" that guide without constraining module innovation
- **Production Robustness:** Handle edge cases including partial completion, input validation, and error recovery

---

## 3. Proposed Changes

### 3.1 Section 3.2.4 Addition: Text Workflow File Lifecycle Management
Add new subsection after existing Section 3.2.3:

#### 3.2.4 Text Workflow File Lifecycle Management
- Detects presence of `accounts_mapping_questions.txt` file in output directory
- Implements complete orchestration through `load_mapping()` function with priority sequence
- Processes completed questions file with structure validation and error recovery
- Implements generational versioning system using rename operations for completed files only
- Coordinates HALT conditions when user interaction requirements detected
- Manages file priority sequence: questions file → specific override → baseline mapping
- Provides structured error recovery guidance for malformed user input
- Handles partial completion scenarios with file preservation for continued editing

#### 3.2.5 Enhanced Questions File Generation
- Generates comprehensive questions file with GnuCash fundamental category guidance
- Emphasizes critical requirement that all accounts must be under Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income, or Expenses
- Includes process explanation and file lifecycle documentation within generated file
- Provides enhanced examples showing proper fundamental categorization
- Instructs users to consult QuickBooks Desktop Chart of Accounts for guidance
- Uses generational rename terminology throughout user-facing content
- Includes ASCII-only character warning with clipboard paste guidance

**Enhanced Questions File Content Requirements:**
```
NON-ASCII CHARACTER WARNING:
This file must contain only standard ASCII characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, basic punctuation).
Non-ASCII characters will cause immediate pipeline failure with descriptive error.
If pasting from QuickBooks, verify no special characters were copied.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
ALL ACCOUNTS MUST BE PLACED UNDER ONE OF THESE 5 FUNDAMENTAL CATEGORIES:
- Assets (bank accounts, receivables, inventory, equipment)
- Liabilities (payables, loans, credit cards, accrued expenses)  
- Equity (owner's equity, retained earnings, capital)
- Income (sales, service revenue, interest income, other income)
- Expenses (operating costs, materials, labor, utilities)
```

### 3.2 Section 5.1 Interface Contract Extensions
Add the following refined interface contracts to existing Section 5.1:

#### Complete Orchestration Interface:
```python
def load_mapping(user_mapping_path: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Load account mapping with integrated text workflow orchestration.
    
    Priority Sequence:
    1. Detect and process completed questions file if present
    2. Load user override file if available  
    3. Fall back to baseline mapping
    
    Internal Orchestration:
    - Calls parse_text_mapping_file() when questions file detected
    - Calls validate_mapping_completeness() to check for partial completion
    - Calls finalize_mapping_file() based on completion status
    - Writes complete results to accounts_mapping_specific.json
    - Handles generational file renaming and archiving
    - Merges configurations with baseline
    """
```

#### Refactored Parsing Interface:
```python
def parse_text_mapping_file(questions_file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Parse questions file with input validation and normalization.
    
    Input Processing Rules:
    - ASCII-only content validation (immediate HALT on non-ASCII)
    - Case normalization for category names
    - Whitespace parsing: single spaces allowed, double spaces terminate parsing
    - Y/N answer extraction: first [yYnN] character detected
    - Special character validation: colons allowed, QBD-valid characters permitted
    
    Args:
        questions_file_path (str): Full path to questions file
    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: Parsed mappings (complete or partial)
    Raises:
        MappingLoadError: Non-ASCII content, invalid characters, or parsing failure
    Note: File operations handled separately by finalize_mapping_file()
    """
```

#### Completeness Validation Interface:
```python
def validate_mapping_completeness(parsed_mappings: Dict[str, Any], 
                                 required_types: List[str]) -> bool:
    """Validate if all required account types have mappings.
    Args:
        parsed_mappings (Dict[str, Any]): Parsed mapping results from questions file
        required_types (List[str]): List of unmapped QBD account types requiring answers
    Returns:
        bool: True if all required types mapped, False if partial completion
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If mapping structure invalid
    """
```

#### File Lifecycle Management Interface:
```python
def finalize_mapping_file(questions_file_path: str, 
                         is_complete: bool, 
                         is_malformed: bool = False) -> None:
    """Manage questions file lifecycle based on processing outcome.
    Args:
        questions_file_path (str): Path to original questions file
        is_complete (bool): True if all mappings complete
        is_malformed (bool): True if file parsing failed
    Side Effects:
        - Complete: Renames to accounts_mapping_questions_v{number}.txt
        - Partial: Preserves original filename for continued editing
        - Malformed: Renames with error suffix
    Raises:
        OutputWriteError: If file operations fail (E0104)
    """
```

#### Enhanced Questions Generation Interface:
```python
def generate_text_mapping_questions(unmapped_types: List[str], output_path: str) -> None:
    """Generate comprehensive questions file with enhanced user guidance.
    Args:
        unmapped_types (List[str]): QBD types requiring mapping
        output_path (str): Directory path for questions file output
    Side Effects:
        Creates accounts_mapping_questions.txt with ASCII warnings and enhanced instructions
    Raises:
        OutputWriteError: If file cannot be written (E0104)
    """
```

### 3.3 Section 6.2.1 Addition: Canonical Error Message Specification
Add canonical error message templates to existing Section 6.2:

### 3.4 Section 9 Addition: Console Logging Standards
Add new major section after existing Section 8:

---

## 9. Console Logging Standards

### 9.1 Hierarchical Tag Convention
This module follows established console logging conventions to maintain consistency across the conversion tool while preserving domain-specific autonomy.

**Tag Structure:**
- `[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING]` - Main mapping configuration and file management
- `[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING]` - Unmapped type detection and text workflow processing

### 9.2 Implementation Requirements
- All console logging uses centralized logging functions (`log_user_info()`, `log_user_error()`, etc.)
- Tags are included in message content, not enforced by core infrastructure
- ASCII characters only for terminal compatibility
- All console output lines must be tagged with appropriate hierarchy

### 9.3 Text Workflow Console Patterns

**Unmapped Type Detection:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Found {count} unmapped account types requiring user input
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Generated questions file: accounts_mapping_questions.txt
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Pipeline HALT: User action required
```

**Questions File Processing:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Found completed questions file, processing user mappings
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Successfully parsed {count} account mappings from questions file
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Questions file renamed to accounts_mapping_questions_v{number}.txt
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Generated mappings saved to accounts_mapping_specific.json
```

**Partial Completion Patterns:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Questions file contains incomplete mappings
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Complete all account type mappings and restart pipeline
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Pipeline HALT: User action required
```

**Error Recovery Patterns:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] File appears corrupted or severely malformed
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Questions file renamed to accounts_mapping_questions_v{number}.txt
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Recommend deleting or renaming the processed file and restarting pipeline
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Pipeline HALT: Processing stopped
```

**Edge Case Handling Patterns:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] File system error occurred during questions file processing
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Non-ASCII content detected - pipeline halted for user correction
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Input validation completed with normalization applied
```

### 9.4 HALT Condition Messaging
- HALT conditions signal user action requirements through console messaging
- Pipeline coordination achieved through `False` return values from module functions
- User guidance emphasizes consulting QuickBooks Desktop Chart of Accounts
- Error recovery instructions provide clear next steps for malformed input
