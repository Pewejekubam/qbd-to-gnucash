**Objective:** 
Finalize deployment and maintain execution integrity.

### **Tasks**
1. Ensure generated code aligns with PRD definitions and is validated against all canonical artifacts in `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/` and `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/schema/` (including `build_map.md`, `core-ir-main-v3.6.5.md`, `master_module_table.md`).
2. Remove all test payloads, temporary files, and code stubs used for earlier validation (e.g., sample payloads, test log calls) from the codebase and documentation before final deployment. If any such items are found, they must be logged. 
3. Set up logging & tracking mechanisms in strict accordance with the latest PRDs (see `prd/logging/module-prd-logging-v1.0.4.md` and `prd/core-prd-main-v3.6.5.md`), ensuring conformance with the Error Class taxonomy  and logging protocols. Logging level to the console must be set to INFO, and storage-based logging (log file) must be set to DEBUG.
4. Audit for unused imports, dependencies, or modules that were only needed for development or testing. Any found items from this audit must be included in the process log.
5. Document final implementation for long-term maintainability, ensuring that all `README.md` files and module-level documentation are up-to-date, accurate, and free of references to development/test artifacts or instructions. Documentation must contain well-documented representations of the current state of related components and structures.
6. Perform a final integration test: run the system end-to-end on a real input file from the input directory and verify that the expected output files are produced and valid.

### **Expected Output**
- Fully operational system, validated against all result artifacts and PRDs.
- Finalized documentation in `README.md` that covers registry/dispatch, logging, error handling, and validation/deployment procedures, and accurately represents the current state of all components.
- Process log includes any found test payloads, stubs, or unused dependencies, and confirms their removal.
