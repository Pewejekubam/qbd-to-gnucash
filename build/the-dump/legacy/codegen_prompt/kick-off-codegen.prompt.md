We are initiating an **Agentic Code Generation Pipeline**, structured for modular and controlled execution.

### **Execution Framework**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Only execute prompts from `logical_flow_canonicalizer/codegen_prompt/`.**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Strictly enforce execution in numerical order, as implied by `Index ID`.**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Explicit human validation is required after each step**

### **Failure Handling Protocol**
üö´ **If a prompt execution fails:**  
   - Halt the pipeline immediately.  
   - Log the failure event to `logs/codegen_execution.log`.  
   - Prompt the human to decide whether to retry, refine, or abort execution.  

### **Structured Logging Requirements**
‚úÖ **Each execution step must log the following data:**  
   - Log entry with timestamp of execution using ISO 8601 format and capture the current system time that populates then entire time down to the second.
   - Prompt `Index ID` executed.  
   - Success or failure state.  
   - Key error messages if applicable.  
   - Log entries are "syslog" style.

### **Agent Directive**
üîπ Execute each stage **precisely as structured**‚Äîdo not skip, reorder, or modify prompts without human approval.  
üîπ Before execution, verify that referenced files exist **only** within the directory and substructure under`logical_flow_canonicalizer/`.  
üîπ Provide structured feedback at each validation checkpoint to ensure clarity in execution results.
