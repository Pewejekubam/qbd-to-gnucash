### üöÄ Index ID: CODEGEN-003

**Objective:** 
Implement functional logic within the generated module stubs.

### **Build Map Reference**
- The build map (`build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/build_map.yaml`) is the canonical reference for:
  - Module generation and implementation sequence.
  - Dependency resolution and orchestration.
  - Validation checkpoints and interface contracts.
- All code generation and logic implementation must:
  - Cross-reference the build map to ensure correct module order and dependencies.
  - Validate that all modules, dependencies, and validation steps are present and aligned with the build map.
  - Log and report any discrepancies between the build map and the generated code.

### **Tasks**
0. **Reference the Build Map**  
   - Before implementing logic, consult `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/build_map.md` to determine:
     - The correct sequence for module implementation.
     - All required dependencies and validation checkpoints.
     - The interface contracts for each module.
   - Use the build map as a checklist to ensure completeness and correctness.
1. Resolve placeholders with actual logic based on:
   - Entry points (`build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/master_module_table.md`).
   - Dependencies (`build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/core-ir-main-v3.6.5.md`).
2. Integrate missing components (e.g., function calls, imports, execution flow).
3. Ensure logging & error handling are properly embedded.

### **Expected Output**
- Fully implemented module files in `src/modules/`.
- Code adheres to dispatch structure & validated dependencies.
- All implemented modules and their integration must be traceable to the build map, with validation checkpoints and interface contracts explicitly referenced.

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Alignment Note
This prompt is strictly downstream from the LFC Build process (`build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/lfc-build-v1.2.0.prompt.md`).  
It must not proceed unless all required build artifacts are present and validated.

### Static vs Dynamic Registry Responsibilities

- **Static Registry (Code-Time/Compile-Time):**
  - The mapping of dispatch keys (e.g., section headers in input files) to modules is defined and maintained manually by the code maintainer.
  - This mapping is established at code generation time and is not modified at runtime.
  - No automatic or dynamic registration of new modules is supported.

- **Dynamic Dispatch (Runtime):**
  - At runtime, the system dynamically dispatches processing of input data (e.g., sections found in IIF files) by looking up the corresponding module in the static registry.
  - Only modules present in the static registry can be dispatched to.
  - If a dispatch key is found in the input that is not present in the static registry, the system logs a warning or error and skips or halts as per PRD.

**This distinction ensures that all code generation and runtime logic strictly follows the intended architecture and governance.**

### Build Map Governance
- The build map is the single source of truth for module orchestration and validation.
- Any changes to module structure, dependencies, or validation must be reflected in the build map and vice versa.

**Codegen Build Prompt Transition:**  
If no errors were encountered during processing, then:  
*"Processing of Index ID: CODEGEN-003 is complete. All prompt module logic has been implemented. Standing by‚Äîwould you like to proceed with Index ID: CODEGEN-004?"*  

If errors were encountered, then:  
*"Processing of Index ID: CODEGEN-003 encountered errors. Please check the execution logs for details. Execution halted. Would you like to review the logs or proceed with Index ID: CODEGEN-004?"*
