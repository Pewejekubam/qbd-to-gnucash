**Objective:** 
Validate system execution with **preemptive dispatch audit** before full execution.

---

### **ðŸ”Ž Preprocessing Validation (Before Execution)**
ðŸ“Œ **Verify Dispatch Handling Mechanisms**  
âœ… Ensure the static registry (code-time mapping of dispatch keys to modules, as defined in `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/build_map.md` and related artifacts) is correctly constructed and used for dispatching structured payloads.  
âœ… Validate that dynamic dispatch at runtime correctly routes payloads to modules present in the static registry.  
âœ… Validate dispatch keys align with `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/core-ir-main-v3.6.5.md` and the static registry.  
âœ… Confirm the accounts module **processes dispatched payloads** (from the static registry) rather than performing direct IIF parsing.

ðŸ“Œ **Reference LFC, PRD Specifications, and Result Artifacts for Accounts Module**
âœ… When implementing the accounts module, reference the Logical Flow Canonicalizer (LFC), all relevant Product Requirements Documents (PRDs), and all related artifacts in `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/` and `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/schema/` (such as `build_map.md`, `core-ir-main-v3.6.5.md`, `master_module_table.md`).  
âœ… Ensure the dispatched payload is processed and converted to `accounts.csv` according to the mapping, validation, and output requirements specified in these documents.  
âœ… The output must conform to the GnuCash CSV import format as defined in the GnuCash Account CSV Schema in section 3.3 of `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/schema/module-ir-accounts-v1.1.3.md`, and all validation rules described in the relevant Product Requirements Documents (`prd/*`).

ðŸ“Œ **Prioritize Logging Validation Before Execution**  
âœ… Implement logging facilities and ensure both console (INFO level) and file (`output/qbd-to-gnucash.log`) (DEBUG level) logging are setup according to the logging protocols defined in `prd/logging/module-prd-logging-v1.0.4.md`. 
âœ… Ensure logging captures system state transitions, error events, and module execution flow in strict accordance with the logging protocols and severity matrix defined in section 8 of `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/schema/core-ir-main-v3.6.5.md` and the requirements in `prd/logging/module-prd-logging-v1.0.4.md`.  
âœ… The codebase at this stage must be runnable enough to execute a test case that produces at least one log entry both on the console and in the output file (`output/qbd-to-gnucash.log`), with the log entry conforming to the required format and metadata fields as specified in `prd/accounts/module-prd-accounts_mapping-v1.0.8.md` "Section 3.2 Detailed Behavior".
âœ… If this minimum logging fitness is not achieved, the prompt must either continue iterating to reach this state or terminate with a clear, actionable error message indicating what is missing or non-compliant.  
âœ… Verify structured error handling via `src/utils/error_handler.py` and ensure all error classes are mapped and logged as specified in the Error Class table Section 8, `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/schema/core-ir-main-v3.6.5.md`.  
âœ… Confirm log entries correspond to dispatched execution flow and error class taxonomy, and that all log entries include required metadata fields for agentic traceability.

ðŸ“Œ **Run Account Conversion Pipeline in Isolation**  
âœ… Validate structured module execution using **pre-dispatched payloads** per interface contracts.  
âœ… Ensure implemented accounts mapping logic (`src/modules/accounts_mapping.py`) correctly translates structured payloads.  
âœ… Identify edge-case failures **before full pipeline execution**.  

Sample input code for minimum viable pipeline test:
```python
from src.main import run_conversion_pipeline

dispatched_payload = {
    'ACCOUNTS': [
        {'NAME': 'Bank', 'TYPE': 'BANK', 'DESC': 'Main checking account'},
        {'NAME': 'Income', 'TYPE': 'INCOME', 'DESC': 'Sales revenue'}
    ]
}

run_conversion_pipeline(dispatched_payload)
```

---

### **ðŸ›  Execution & Debugging (Post-Validation)**
ðŸ“Œ **Run Core Execution Calls**  
âœ… Execute `run_conversion_pipeline()` using **validated static registry-based dispatch routing**.  
âœ… Verify structured module execution paths in the generated code align with the Logical Flow Diagram (LFD) `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/lfd.md` and the static registry.  
âœ… Verify by examining the output of logs to both console (INFO level) and file (`output/qbd-to-gnucash.log`) (DEBUG level) that the log output is produced in compliance with `build\logical_flow_canonicalizer\schema\core-ir-main-v3.6.5.md` and `prd\logging\module-prd-logging-v1.0.4.md`.
âœ… Identify remaining integration failures **without redundant function execution**.

ðŸ“Œ **Checklist for Final Verification**  
âœ… Ensure all components in the generated code are correctly linked via static registry-based dispatch logic.  
âœ… Confirm no misplaced dependencies or execution gaps in the generated code by referencing `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/build_map.md` and `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/master_module_table.md`.  
âœ… Ensure logging and error handling mechanisms are **fully integrated** and validated against the Error Class table and logging PRD.

### **Result Artifacts Leverage**
- All validation and audit processes must fully utilize the artifacts in `./build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/` (including `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/build_map.md`, `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/schema/core-ir-main-v3.6.5.md`, `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/master_module_table.md`) for module orchestration, dependency validation, and interface contract verification.

---

### Static vs Dynamic Registry Responsibilities

- **Static Registry (Code-Time/Compile-Time):**
  - The mapping of dispatch keys (e.g., section headers in input files) to modules is defined and maintained manually by the code maintainer.
  - This mapping is established at code generation time and is not modified at runtime.
  - No automatic or dynamic registration of new modules is supported.

- **Dynamic Dispatch (Runtime):**
  - At runtime, the system dynamically dispatches processing of input data (e.g., sections found in IIF files) by looking up the corresponding module in the static registry.
  - Only modules present in the static registry can be dispatched to.
  - If a dispatch key is found in the input that is not present in the static registry, the system logs a warning or error and skips or halts as per PRD.

**This distinction ensures that all code generation and runtime logic strictly follows the intended architecture and governance.**

---

### **Recommendations for Agentic Codegen Compatibility**
- Ensure all validation, orchestration, and audit steps are explicitly cross-referenced to result artifacts and PRDs.
- Require that any discrepancies or missing dependencies are logged and reported with reference to the static registry and `build/logical_flow_canonicalizer/result-files/build_map.md`.
- Encourage modular, testable code and validation routines that can be executed in isolation using sample payloads.
- Mandate that all logging and error handling is validated against the latest PRD (`prd/`) specifications and error class taxonomy (see: `prd/core-prd-main-v3.6.5.md##16. Authoritative Error Classes & Error Code Table`).

**Codegen Build Prompt Transition:**  
If no errors were encountered during processing, then:  
*"Processing of Index ID: CODEGEN-004 is complete. All prompt module logic has been implemented. Standing byâ€”would you like to proceed with Index ID: CODEGEN-005?"*  

If errors were encountered, then:  
*"Processing of Index ID: CODEGEN-004 encountered errors. Please check the execution logs for details. Execution halted. Would you like to review the logs or proceed with Index ID: CODEGEN-005?"*
