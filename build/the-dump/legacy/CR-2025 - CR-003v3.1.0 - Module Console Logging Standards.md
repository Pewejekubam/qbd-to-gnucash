# Change Request CR-003: Module Console Logging Standards & Text Workflow Enhancement

**Document Version:** CR-003-v3.1.0  
**Change Request ID:** CR-003  
**Target Document:** module-prd-accounts_mapping-v1.1.0.md  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Date:** 2025-06-12  
**Status:** Ready for Approval  

---

## 1. Overview
Enhance module-prd-accounts_mapping to include standardized console logging conventions and complete text workflow implementation documentation. This change brings the PRD into full alignment with working code capabilities while establishing console logging patterns for horizontal module scaling.

---

## 2. Rationale

### 2.1 Console Logging Standards
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Establish consistent console output patterns for future modules (sales_tax, customers, vendors)
- **User Experience:** Provide scannable, hierarchical console logs showing processing flow
- **Domain Autonomy:** Maintain module control over specific console messaging
- **Pattern Consistency:** Create soft standards that guide without constraining module innovation

### 2.2 Text Workflow Documentation Gap
- **Critical User Safety:** Enhanced questions file prevents GnuCash structure violations
- **HALT Condition Clarity:** Pipeline behavior for user action requirements needs specification
- **File Lifecycle Management:** Generational versioning and error recovery patterns need documentation

---

## 3. Proposed Changes

### 3.1 Section 3.2.4 Addition: Text Workflow File Lifecycle Management

Add new subsection after existing Section 3.2.3:

#### 3.2.4 Text Workflow File Lifecycle Management
- Detects presence of `accounts_mapping_questions.txt` file in output directory
- Processes completed questions file with structure validation and error recovery
- Implements generational versioning system using rename operations
- Coordinates HALT conditions when user interaction requirements detected
- Manages file priority sequence: questions file → specific override → baseline mapping
- Provides structured error recovery guidance for malformed user input

#### 3.2.5 Enhanced Questions File Generation
- Generates comprehensive questions file with GnuCash fundamental category guidance
- Emphasizes critical requirement that all accounts must be under Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Income, or Expenses
- Includes process explanation and file lifecycle documentation within generated file
- Provides enhanced examples showing proper fundamental categorization
- Instructs users to consult QuickBooks Desktop Chart of Accounts for guidance
- Uses generational rename terminology throughout user-facing content

### 3.2 Section 5.1 Interface Contract Extensions

Add the following interface contracts to existing Section 5.1:

#### `generate_text_mapping_questions`
```python
def generate_text_mapping_questions(unmapped_types: List[str], output_path: str) -> None:
    """Creates comprehensive questions file emphasizing GnuCash fundamental categories."""
    # Enhanced implementation with critical requirements section
```

#### `parse_text_mapping_file`
```python
def parse_text_mapping_file(questions_file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Parses completed questions file with validation and generational rename."""
    # HALT condition: Returns parsed mappings or raises MappingLoadError
```

#### HALT Condition Specifications
- Functions return `False` when user action required for unmapped account types
- Pipeline coordination signals HALT through boolean return values
- Error recovery guidance provided through structured logging patterns
- Generational file naming follows pattern: `accounts_mapping_questions_v{number}.txt`

### 3.6 New Section 9: Console Logging Standards

Add detailed schema validation specification to existing Section 4.1:

#### 4.1.1 Mapping File Schema Structure
The mapping validation shall use the following embedded JSON schema for validation:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["account_types", "default_rules"],
  "properties": {
    "account_types": {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": {
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["gnucash_type", "destination_hierarchy"],
        "properties": {
          "gnucash_type": {
            "type": "string",
            "enum": ["ASSET", "LIABILITY", "EQUITY", "INCOME", "EXPENSE", 
                   "RECEIVABLE", "PAYABLE", "CASH", "BANK", "STOCK", 
                   "MUTUAL", "CREDIT", "ROOT", "TRADING"]
          },
          "destination_hierarchy": {
            "type": "string",
            "minLength": 1,
            "pattern": "^[^:]*(?::[^:]+)*$"
          }
        },
        "additionalProperties": false
      }
    },
    "default_rules": {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": {
        "oneOf": [
          {"type": "string"},
          {
            "type": "object",
            "required": ["gnucash_type", "destination_hierarchy"],
            "properties": {
              "gnucash_type": {"type": "string"},
              "destination_hierarchy": {"type": "string"}
            },
            "additionalProperties": false
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": true
}
```

#### 4.1.2 Validation Algorithm Requirements
- Validate top-level structure as JSON object with required fields
- Enumerate and validate each account_types entry against schema
- Validate gnucash_type against allowed enumeration values
- Validate destination_hierarchy format using regex pattern matching
- Check for invalid characters in hierarchy paths: `/, \, <, >, |, ", *, ?`
- Detect double colons (::) or leading/trailing colons in hierarchy paths
- Support both string and object formats in default_rules section
- Return list of validation error messages with file path context

### 3.5 Section 6.2 Addition: Canonical Error Message Specification

Add canonical error message templates to existing Section 6.2:

#### 6.2.1 Text Workflow Error Messages

**File Processing Messages:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Found completed questions file, processing user mappings
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Successfully parsed {count} account mappings from questions file
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Questions file renamed to accounts_mapping_questions_v{number}.txt
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Generated mappings saved to accounts_mapping_specific.json
```

**Error Conditions:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] File appears corrupted or severely malformed
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Questions file renamed to accounts_mapping_questions_v{number}.txt
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Recommend deleting or renaming the processed file and restarting pipeline
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Pipeline HALT: Processing stopped
```

**User Guidance Messages:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Found {count} unmapped account types requiring user input
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Generated questions file: accounts_mapping_questions.txt
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Edit the file and restart pipeline to continue
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Pipeline HALT: User action required
```

#### 6.2.2 Schema Validation Error Templates

**File Structure Errors:**
```
{file_path}: Root must be a JSON object
{file_path}: Missing required field '{field_name}'
{file_path}: 'account_types' must be an object
{file_path}: 'default_rules' must be an object
```

**Account Type Validation Errors:**
```
{file_path}: Account type '{qbd_type}' must be an object
{file_path}: Account type '{qbd_type}' missing required field '{field_name}'
{file_path}: Account type '{qbd_type}' field '{field_name}' must be a string
{file_path}: Account type '{qbd_type}' field '{field_name}' cannot be empty
{file_path}: Account type '{qbd_type}' has invalid gnucash_type '{gnucash_type}'. Valid types: {sorted_valid_types}
```

**Hierarchy Format Errors:**
```
{file_path}: Account type '{qbd_type}' hierarchy contains invalid character '{char}'
{file_path}: Account type '{qbd_type}' hierarchy contains double colons '::'
{file_path}: Account type '{qbd_type}' hierarchy cannot start or end with ':'
```

Add new major section after existing Section 8:

## 9. Console Logging Standards

### 9.1 Hierarchical Tag Convention
This module follows established console logging conventions to maintain consistency across the conversion tool while preserving domain-specific autonomy.

**Tag Structure:**
- `[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING]` - Main mapping configuration and file management
- `[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING]` - Unmapped type detection and text workflow processing
- `[PIPELINE]` - Reserved for core pipeline-level messaging (not used by modules)

### 9.2 Implementation Requirements
- All console logging uses centralized logging functions (`log_user_info()`, `log_user_error()`, etc.)
- Tags are included in message content, not enforced by core infrastructure
- ASCII characters only for terminal compatibility
- All console output lines must be tagged with appropriate hierarchy

### 9.3 Text Workflow Console Patterns

**Unmapped Type Detection:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Found {count} unmapped account types requiring user input
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Generated questions file: accounts_mapping_questions.txt
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Pipeline HALT: User action required
```

**Questions File Processing:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Found completed questions file, processing user mappings
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Successfully parsed {count} account mappings from questions file
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Questions file renamed to accounts_mapping_questions_v{number}.txt
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Generated mappings saved to accounts_mapping_specific.json
```

**Error Recovery Patterns:**
```
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] File appears corrupted or severely malformed
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Questions file renamed to accounts_mapping_questions_v{number}.txt
[ACCOUNTS-MAPPING] Recommend deleting or renaming the processed file and restarting pipeline
[ACCOUNTS-UNMAPPED-PROCESSING] Pipeline HALT: Processing stopped
```

### 9.4 HALT Condition Messaging
- HALT conditions signal user action requirements through console messaging
- Pipeline coordination achieved through `False` return values from module functions
- User guidance emphasizes consulting QuickBooks Desktop Chart of Accounts
- Error recovery instructions provide clear next steps for malformed input

### 9.5 Enhanced Questions File Content Specification

Generated questions file must include this complete structure:

**File Header:**
```
Where should these accounts go in GnuCash?

{UNMAPPED_TYPE}: 
Is this a child account? (Y/N): 
If yes, parent account name: 
```

**Critical Requirements Section:**
```
================================================================================
ABOUT THIS FILE:
This file helps map QuickBooks account types that aren't in the baseline configuration.
After you complete this file and restart the pipeline, it will:
1. Process your mappings and continue the conversion
2. Generate accounts.csv for GnuCash import
3. Rename this file as accounts_mapping_questions_v###.txt

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:
ALL ACCOUNTS MUST BE PLACED UNDER ONE OF THESE 5 FUNDAMENTAL CATEGORIES:
- Assets (bank accounts, receivables, inventory, equipment)
- Liabilities (payables, loans, credit cards, accrued expenses)  
- Equity (owner's equity, retained earnings, capital)
- Income (sales, service revenue, interest income, other income)
- Expenses (operating costs, materials, labor, utilities)
```

**Enhanced Instructions Section:**
```
INSTRUCTIONS:

1. For each account above, enter the GnuCash account name you want to use
2. If it's a child account, answer Y and provide the parent account path
3. Use colons (:) to separate account levels for deep hierarchies
4. Review and consult your QuickBooks Desktop Chart of Accounts to help guide you in answering the three questions needed to accurately map the accounts to GnuCash

EXAMPLES - All accounts must go under one of the 5 fundamental categories:

Assets Example:
  PETTY_CASH: Office Petty Cash
  Is this a child account? (Y/N): Y
  If yes, parent account name: Assets:Current Assets

Income Example:
  CONSULTING_FEES: Consulting Revenue
  Is this a child account? (Y/N): Y  
  If yes, parent account name: Income:Service Revenue

Expenses Example:
  OFFICE_SUPPLIES: Office Supplies
  Is this a child account? (Y/N): Y
  If yes, parent account name: Expenses:Office Expenses

PARSING CHECK: 
When you're done editing, make sure each account has ALL required fields filled in:
- Account name (after the colon)
- Child account answer (Y or N)
- Parent account name (if you answered Y)
Leave this section unchanged.
================================================================================
